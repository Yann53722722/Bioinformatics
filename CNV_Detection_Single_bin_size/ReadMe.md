CNV Detection Algorithm:

This program is developed to detect the Copy Number Variations (CNVs) in the person genome.
In this algorithm, we are using  a single bin size of 50,000 base (generated by HMMcopy program using the person bam file) to get the read-count and gc-value.


How to use: There are 2 steps in this program:

1. Reference_Database_builder.py : This scripts uses the normal patients files (generated by HMMcopy) and generates the mean and standard deviation value for each bin (saved as Reference_database.txt). These values will be used to calculcate the z-score to find the CNV (apmplications/deletions) regions and make the read-distribution plot for each chromosome.

2. CNV_Detector.py : CNV_Detector program's takes a single person (suspected to have CNV) read_count file generatd by the HMMcopy using the bam file. This program requires the Reference_database generatd by the Reference_Database_builder.py script as input.
(IMPORTANT: The bin size must be same for both the programs.)
	This script generates a text file which lists the CNVs (amplifications/deletions) in the samples and generates a interactive scatter plot using the Bokeh visualization library.
